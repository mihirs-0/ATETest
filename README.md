# ATE Test Data Analysis Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates an Automated Test Equipment (ATE) data analysis system, similar to what's used in semiconductor manufacturing. It demonstrates my ability to work with manufacturing data analysis, generate actionable insights, and automate reporting.

## Why This Project?
This simulation was created to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Semiconductor manufacturing data analysis
- ATE test coverage and yield analysis
- Automated reporting and alerting systems
- Foundry manufacturing processes and metrics

The project directly aligns with the key responsibilities of the role:
1. **Manufacturing Data Analysis**: The system analyzes key manufacturing metrics like yield, cost, and test coverage
2. **Automation**: Python scripts and dashboards automate analysis and generate alerts
3. **ATE Test Understanding**: The simulation includes realistic test bin data and coverage analysis
4. **System Validation**: The dashboard provides insights into test performance and power metrics

## Key Features

### 1. Manufacturing Data Analysis
- **Yield Analysis**: Tracks and analyzes wafer yield trends over time
- **Test Coverage**: Monitors and reports on test bin coverage
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculates cost per good die and identifies cost optimization opportunities
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between different test parameters

### 2. Automated Reporting & Alerts
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of manufacturing metrics
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for yield drops and test coverage issues
- **Data Generation**: Simulates realistic manufacturing test data
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks performance metrics over time

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Python Data Analysis**: Uses pandas and numpy for efficient data processing
- **Interactive Visualization**: Plotly Dash for real-time dashboard updates
- **Automated Alerts**: Email and Slack integration for critical notifications
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and trend detection

## Technical Stack
